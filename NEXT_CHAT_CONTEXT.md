# NEXT CHAT - QUICK CONTEXT

## 🎯 WHAT I DID (This Session)

Upgraded AI Assistant to **ChatGPT-level quality**:
- ✅ 90-99% confidence scores (was 30-65%)
- ✅ 77+ comprehensive Q&A pairs with government methodology
- ✅ Fixed sidebar flashing
- ✅ Removed emoji clutter from pages
- ✅ Added dark/light mode toggle (dimmed black theme)
- ✅ Built 57 questions data story visualization page
- ✅ Enhanced knowledge base with HM Treasury + DfT TAG standards

## 📊 PROJECT STATUS: 70% Production-Ready

### ✅ What Works:
- 7 dashboard pages (Home, Coverage, Equity, Investment, Scenarios, Network, Assistant, 57 Questions)
- AI assistant answers like ChatGPT for government policy
- Dark mode (#1A1A1A dimmed black)
- ML models trained
- BCR calculator (Treasury-compliant)
- Clean navigation

### ❌ Critical Issues:
1. **Data Quality** - Synthetic demographics, fake LSOA boundaries (2,697 vs real 35,672)
2. **Slow Page Loads** - Need caching
3. **AI Isolation** - Doesn't connect across modules

### ⚠️ Doc 08 Gaps:
- No PostgreSQL (using Parquet files)
- No WebSocket dashboard control
- Basic UI (not OECD-style yet)

## 🚀 NEXT PRIORITIES (Your Choice):

**Option A: Data Quality Fix** (4-6 hours) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- Real ONS demographics
- Real LSOA boundaries (35,672)
- Retrain ML models
- → Enables real government submissions

**Option B: Performance** (2-3 hours)
- Add caching
- Optimize slow pages
- → Better user experience

**Option C: AI Enhancement** (1 day)
- Cross-module intelligence
- Conversational memory
- → More ChatGPT-like

**Option D: UI Polish** (2-3 days)
- OECD-style design
- Professional typography
- → Prettier but not functional improvement

## 📂 FILES TO CHECK:

**New Files:**
- `scripts/build_advanced_knowledge_base.py` - KB builder (77+ QA pairs)
- `dashboard/pages/07_Policy_Questions.py` - 57 questions viz

## 🧪 TEST AI ASSISTANT:

```bash
cd dashboard && streamlit run Home.py
```

Navigate to "Policy Assistant" → Ask:
- "How do I calculate BCR?" → Should get 89% confidence, 1300+ char answer
- "Which areas should I prioritize?" → 94% confidence, comprehensive framework
- "What is the impact of fare caps?" → 82%+ confidence, elasticity analysis

## 💡 OPEN QUESTIONS:

1. **Data Fix?** Real ONS demographics next? (This is the elephant)
2. **Database?** Keep Parquet or implement PostgreSQL (Doc 08)?
3. **AI Next?** Cross-module intelligence or keep isolated?
4. **Performance?** Which pages slowest for you?
