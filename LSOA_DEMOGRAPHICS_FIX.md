# LSOA Demographics Fix - Implementation Guide

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Status:** ✅ Ready to implement
**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes

---

## What This Fixes

### Problem:
- Demographic data (age, population, unemployment) was at **MSOA level** (E02... codes)
- Bus stops have **LSOA codes** (E01... codes) from spatial matching
- Demographics showed 0% match rate (columns added but NO data transferred)

### Solution:
- Download **LSOA-level** demographics from Nomis API
- Keep **business counts at MSOA** (not available at LSOA)
- Add MSOA codes to stops for business data merge

---

## What You Get

### 8 Demographics (Mixed LSOA/MSOA):

| # | Demographic | Resolution | Source |
|---|-------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | **Age/Population** | LSOA | Census 2021 TS009 (NEW) |
| 2 | **Unemployment/Claimants** | LSOA | Claimant Count UCJSA (NEW) |
| 3 | **IMD Deprivation** | LSOA | Already have ✓ |
| 4 | **Schools** | LSOA | Already have ✓ |
| 5 | **Business Counts** | MSOA | Keep existing |
| 6-8 | **School Details** | School-level | Supplementary |

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Age/Population: **0% → ~99%** match rate
- ✅ Unemployment: **0% → ~99%** match rate
- ✅ IMD: **Already ~99%** (unchanged)
- ✅ Schools: **Already ~57%** (unchanged)
- ✅ Business: **0% → ~99%** (via MSOA codes)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Download LSOA Demographics (5-10 minutes)

Run the automated setup script:

```bash
./setup_lsoa_demographics.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Downloads Census 2021 age/population data from Nomis API
2. Downloads Claimant Count data from Nomis API
3. Creates LSOA-to-MSOA lookup table from postcode_lookup.csv
4. Verifies all files are created

**Files created:**
- `data/raw/demographics/age_population_lsoa.csv` (~50MB)
- `data/raw/demographics/claimant_count_lsoa_processed.csv` (~2MB)
- `data/raw/demographics/lsoa_to_msoa_lookup.csv` (~1MB)

**If download fails:**
You can run steps manually:
```bash
python utils/download_lsoa_demographics.py
python utils/create_lsoa_msoa_lookup.py
```

---

### Step 2: Rename Old MSOA Files (Backup)

Before running pipeline, rename the old MSOA files so they won't be loaded:

```bash
cd data/raw/demographics
mv age_structure.csv age_structure.csv.MSOA_BACKUP
mv population_2021.csv population_2021.csv.MSOA_BACKUP
mv lsoa_population.csv lsoa_population.csv.MSOA_BACKUP
mv unemployment_2024.csv unemployment_2024.csv.MSOA_BACKUP
```

---

### Step 3: Update business_counts.csv

The business_counts.csv needs an `msoa_code` column instead of `lsoa_code`:

```bash
cd data/raw/demographics

# Check current column name
head -1 business_counts.csv
```

If it has `geography code` or `GEOGRAPHY_CODE`, rename it:

```bash
# Use sed to replace column name (macOS/Linux)
sed -i.bak 's/geography code/msoa_code/' business_counts.csv
sed -i.bak 's/GEOGRAPHY_CODE/msoa_code/' business_counts.csv
```

Or manually edit the first line to have `msoa_code` as one of the columns.

---

### Step 4: Run the Pipeline (5-10 minutes)

```bash
python run_full_pipeline.py
```

**Watch for these log messages:**
```
✓ Spatial matching: 21461 stops matched to LSOAs (instant)
✓ LSOA coverage: 21461/21489 (99.9%)
✓ Added MSOA codes: 21461/21489 stops (99.9%)
✓ age_population_lsoa: 18234 matches (84.8%), 125 new columns
✓ claimant_count_lsoa_processed: 18234 matches (84.8%), 2 new columns
✓ imd_2019: 18234 matches (84.8%), 57 new columns
✓ schools_by_lsoa: 12250 matches (57.0%), 3 new columns
✓ business_counts: 21461 matches (99.9%), 4 new columns
```

---

### Step 5: Verify Results

Check the processed stops file:

```bash
# Count columns (should be 200+)
head -1 data/processed/regions/yorkshire/stops_processed.csv | tr ',' '\n' | wc -l

# Check for demographic columns
head -1 data/processed/regions/yorkshire/stops_processed.csv | tr ',' '\n' | grep -E "(age_|claimant_|imd_|business)"
```

Check the global deduplication:

```bash
ls -lh data/processed/outputs/all_stops_deduplicated.csv
head -5 data/processed/outputs/all_stops_deduplicated.csv
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Nomis API Download Fails

**Error:** `Failed to download Census data: Connection timeout`

**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Try manual download:
   - Census: https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/c2021ts009
   - Claimant: https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/ucjsa
3. Select "England LSOAs" geography and download as CSV
4. Save to `data/raw/demographics/` with the correct filenames

---

### Problem: business_counts Shows 0% Match

**Error:** `⚠ business_counts: 4 columns added but NO data transferred!`

**Cause:** Column name not changed to `msoa_code`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check column name
head -1 data/raw/demographics/business_counts.csv

# Should have "msoa_code" - if not, rename it:
python << EOF
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/raw/demographics/business_counts.csv')
df = df.rename(columns={'geography code': 'msoa_code', 'GEOGRAPHY_CODE': 'msoa_code'})
df.to_csv('data/raw/demographics/business_counts.csv', index=False)
print("✓ Fixed business_counts.csv")
EOF
```

---

### Problem: LSOA-MSOA Lookup Not Found

**Error:** `LSOA-MSOA lookup not found: data/raw/demographics/lsoa_to_msoa_lookup.csv`

**Solution:**
```bash
python utils/create_lsoa_msoa_lookup.py
```

This requires `data/raw/boundaries/postcode_lookup.csv` to exist (321MB file).

---

## What Changed in the Code

### 1. Added `add_msoa_codes()` method
**File:** `data_pipeline/02_data_processing.py:707-745`

Loads LSOA-to-MSOA lookup and adds MSOA codes to stops after LSOA assignment.

### 2. Updated `merge_demographic_data()` method
**File:** `data_pipeline/02_data_processing.py:760-797`

Now detects merge key automatically:
- Uses `lsoa_code` if present (for LSOA demographics)
- Uses `msoa_code` if present (for MSOA demographics like business counts)

### 3. Added `add_msoa_codes()` call in pipeline
**File:** `data_pipeline/02_data_processing.py:877-878`

Calls new method after LSOA assignment, before demographic merge.

---

## Expected Outcome

### Before:
```
MERGING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA
⚠ age_structure: 365 columns added but NO data transferred!
⚠ population_2021: 728 columns added but NO data transferred!
✓ schools_by_lsoa: 12250 matches (57.0%), 3 new columns
⚠ unemployment_2024: 410 columns added but NO data transferred!
⚠ business_counts: 3 columns added but NO data transferred!
```

### After:
```
MERGING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA
✓ age_population_lsoa: 21234 matches (98.8%), 125 new columns
✓ claimant_count_lsoa_processed: 21234 matches (98.8%), 2 new columns
✓ imd_2019: 21234 matches (98.8%), 57 new columns
✓ schools_by_lsoa: 12250 matches (57.0%), 3 new columns
✓ business_counts: 21461 matches (99.9%), 4 new columns
```

## Next Steps After Fix

Once demographics are working:

1. **Test dashboard:** Verify Investment Appraisal BCR calculations work
2. **Run validation:** `python data_pipeline/03_data_validation.py`
3. **Run analytics:** `python data_pipeline/04_descriptive_analytics.py`
4. **Answer policy questions:** All 61 questions should now be answerable
