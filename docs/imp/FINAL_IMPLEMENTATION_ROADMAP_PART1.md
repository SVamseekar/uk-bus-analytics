## 🚨 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL UPDATE (Nov 4, 2025)

**During Task 1.4, we built a comprehensive Insight Engine to eliminate hardcoded narratives across all 50+ sections.**

**What Changed:**
- ✅ All dashboard sections now use **dynamic narrative generation**
- ✅ Zero hardcoded values (£42M, BCR 2.1, correlations, etc.)
- ✅ Context-aware narratives (adapts to filters intelligently)
- ✅ Evidence-gated insights (only shows what data supports)
- ✅ TAG 2024 & HM Treasury Green Book compliant

**Insight Engine: 7 modules, 1,633 lines**
```
dashboard/utils/insight_engine/
├── context.py      - Filter-aware view resolution
├── calc.py         - TAG 2024 constants + calculators
├── config.py       - Metric configurations
├── rules.py        - 6 evidence-gated insight rules
├── templates.py    - Jinja2 consulting-tone templates
├── engine.py       - Orchestrator
└── README.md       - Architecture docs
```

**Impact:**
- Task 1.4: 8h → 12h (one-time investment)
- Future sections: 3h → 2h each (engine does narrative work)
- Maintenance: Zero (no hardcoded text to update)
- Quality: Professional consulting standard across all 50 sections

- IMD 2019: 99-100% match rate
- Unemployment 2024: 96-99% match rate
- Schools: 76-81% match rate
- Business counts: 96-99% match rate (MSOA level)

### 📦 WHAT'S ARCHIVED (Salvageable Assets)

**Location:** `archive_20251031_cleanup/`

**High-Value Components:**
- ✅ Dashboard skeleton (7 pages built with OECD-style CSS)
- ✅ BCR calculator (UK Treasury Green Book compliant - 482 lines)
- ✅ Policy scenario simulator (550 lines - fare caps, frequency changes)
- ✅ Economic impact modeling (554 lines - GDP multipliers, employment)
- ✅ ML models (need retraining on real data):
  - Route clustering (93MB)
  - Anomaly detector (1.4MB)
  - Coverage predictor (2.4MB)
- ✅ Professional UI components (776 lines custom CSS)

**Status:** Ready to rebuild on TRUE DATA foundation

### ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS WORK

**Critical Path Items:**

1. **TransXChange Schedule Parsing (NOT DONE YET)**
   - Have: 206 XML files with route/schedule data
   - Need: Extract trip schedules, frequencies, route geometries
   - Effort: 6-8 hours
   - Unlocks: 11 questions (B9, B10, B12, B15, C17-C21, C23)

2. **Update to 2024 TAG Standards**
   - Current: Generic monetary values
   - Need: DfT TAG 2024 official values
   - Time savings: £12.65/hr (bus commuting)
   - Carbon: £80/tonne CO₂
   - Effort: 4 hours

3. **Missing Quick-Win Datasets (30 minutes total)**
   - Rural-Urban Classification (5 min download)
   - LSOA Boundaries GeoJSON (5 min download)
   - Car Ownership Census 2021 (5 min download)
   - Unlocks: 5 questions (A6, A7, B16, D28, D29)

4. **Category Pages (NOT BUILT YET)**
   - Have: Dashboard skeleton
   - Need: 10 categories × questions with visualizations + data stories
   - This is the MAIN WORK (Weeks 2-4)

5. **AI Assistant Knowledge Base**
   - Have: Plan and architecture
   - Need: Llama Index integration + knowledge base loading
   - Effort: 2 days (not 5 with Llama Index!)

### ❌ WHAT'S GENUINELY MISSING (Accept as Limitation)

**Not Available for Now:**
- ❌ Ridership data (operator-proprietary, consulting firms pay £10k-50k for this)
- ❌ Real-time reliability tracking (need operator SIRI-VM access)
- ❌ Multi-year temporal trends (need historical data collection - DEFERRED)
- ❌ Journey time reliability (need real-time feeds)

**Impact:** These are consulting firm advantages. We deliver 85-90% of consulting value without them.

## 3. PROJECT PHILOSOPHY - LESSONS FROM THE JOURNEY

### 🎯 GLOBAL DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (APPLIES TO ENTIRE PLATFORM)

**CRITICAL: This is NOT an academic research tool. This is a professional consulting intelligence platform.**

#### User Interface & Language Style

**❌ NEVER USE (Academic/Questionnaire Style):**
- "8 questions analyzing..."
- "Question A1:", "Question D24:"
- "📖 Data Story"
- "💡 Key Insight"
- "Answer:", "Analysis:", "Findings:"
- Academic section numbering (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
- Research paper terminology
- Overly technical jargon without context

**✅ ALWAYS USE (Consulting Report Style):**
- **Professional section titles:** "Regional Route Density Analysis", "Service Coverage Assessment", "Investment Priority Zones"
- **Executive language:** "Key Finding", "Policy Recommendation", "Investment Requirement"
- **Actionable headers:** "What This Means", "Action Required", "Expected Impact"
- **Consulting firm tone:** McKinsey, Deloitte, PwC style
- **Decision-maker focus:** Clear, concise, actionable
- **Evidence-based:** Data-driven but accessible

#### Visual Design

**❌ AVOID:**
- Cluttered dashboards with too many metrics
- Academic chart titles ("Figure 1: Distribution of...")
- Unnecessary labels and annotations
- Question IDs visible to users (A1, D24, etc.)

**✅ IMPLEMENT:**
- Clean, spacious layouts
- Professional chart titles ("Bus Routes per 100,000 Population by Region")
- Minimal but meaningful annotations
- Question IDs only in backend code/comments
- White space and visual hierarchy
- OECD/World Bank report aesthetic

#### Content Structure

**Every Analysis Section Should Have:**
1. **Professional Title** - Clear, descriptive (not "Question X")
2. **Visualization** - Clean chart/map (no "📊 Visualization" label needed)
3. **Narrative** - Executive summary style (2-3 paragraphs max)
4. **Key Finding** - One critical insight highlighted
5. **Policy Recommendation** - Actionable next steps with BCR/cost estimates
6. **Related Analysis Links** - Cross-references to other sections

#### Navigation & Organization

**Homepage:**
- Interactive UK map (no labels like "5 switchable views")
- National overview metrics (clean cards)
- Auto-generated insights (professional language)

**Category Pages:**
- Single scrollable page per category
- Professional category titles in sidebar
- No mention of "X questions" to users
- Smooth scrolling between analysis sections

**Cross-Linking:**
- "View related analysis" (not "See Question D24")
- Contextual recommendations
- Intelligent navigation flows

#### Target Audience Adaptation

**For Policy Makers:**
- Lead with impact and BCR
- Clear investment requirements
- Headline findings first, details second

**For Transport Company CEOs:**
- Efficiency metrics prominent
- Profitability implications
- Operational optimization opportunities

**For Urban Planners:**
- Spatial analysis emphasis
- Gap identification clear
- Service recommendations specific

**For Researchers:**
- Methodology transparency
- Data quality metrics
- Reproducibility notes

#### Example Transformation

**❌ BEFORE (Academic Style):**
```
QUESTION A1: Which regions have the highest number of bus routes per capita?

📖 DATA STORY
Manchester has 42 routes per 100k...

💡 KEY INSIGHT
Route density varies...
```

**✅ AFTER (Consulting Style):**
```
Regional Route Density Analysis

Manchester leads the nation with 42 routes per 100,000 population,
providing extensive network connectivity and multiple journey options
for residents. In contrast, East Midlands operates only 5.7 routes
per 100k, limiting travel options for 4.8 million residents.

Key Finding
Route density varies 7.4x between regions. Network design and policy
choices matter more than population scale alone - smaller regions can
achieve high route density through strategic investment.

Policy Recommendation
Five regions fall below the national average of 8.3 routes per 100k.
Estimated investment to bring bottom 3 regions to average: £42M
(BCR: 2.1 - High value for money per HM Treasury Green Book standards).

Priority actions: (1) Identify underserved corridors, (2) Design routes
connecting employment centers, (3) Integrate with existing services.

**This philosophy applies to:**
- All 10 category pages
- Homepage design
- All visualizations
- All data stories
- AI assistant responses
- Export reports
- Documentation shown to users

**Exception:** Internal code comments and developer documentation can use technical references (A1, D24, etc.)

### The Honest Reset (October 31, 2025)

**What Happened:**
- Built dashboard in 3 weeks (Sept 27 - Oct 29)
- Discovered critical data quality issues on Oct 29
- Made decisive choice: Archive everything, fix foundation
- Committed to TRUTH over POLISH

**Key Learnings:**

1. **Data Quality First, Features Second**
   - DON'T build dashboards on fake data
   - DO validate demographic integration before building analytics
   - DON'T claim 3 million stops when you have duplicates
   - DO honest audits with brutal honesty

2. **Foundation Over Features**
   - 3 weeks of work archived without hesitation
   - Rebuilt data pipeline properly
   - Achieved 97% demographic accuracy with REAL ONS data
   - Result: Production-grade foundation

3. **Document Actual, Not Aspirational**
   - Tech spec claimed "GPT-4" → Actually used Sentence Transformers (FREE)
   - Claimed "PostgreSQL" → Actually used CSV/Parquet (simpler)
   - Learning: Document what you BUILT, not what you PLANNED

4. **Honest Problem-Solving**
   - 6 critical bugs found and documented
   - Data accuracy report showed reality
   - Chose to restart rather than polish broken system
   - Integrity > Speed

### Your Philosophy: Data Stories, Not Just Charts

**From Your Vision:**
- **Categories → Questions → Data Stories** (not just visualizations)
- Each answer includes narrative explaining "what this means"
- Insight cards showing policy implications
- Visualizations support the story, not the other way around

**Example - NOT This:**
```
❌ Chart showing stops per capita by region
   (no context, no interpretation)
```

**Example - YES This:**
```
✅ "The North East faces a service coverage crisis"

   DATA: 4.1 stops per 1,000 population (34% below national average)

   VISUALIZATION: Choropleth map showing North East in red

   INSIGHT: "This gap affects 2.6 million residents, with 1,247 LSOAs
            classified as underserved. Deprived areas (IMD Decile 1-3)
            are disproportionately affected, receiving 42% less service
            than affluent areas."

   POLICY IMPLICATION: "Targeted investment of £87M could close this gap,
                       delivering a BCR of 2.3 (High value for money per
                       HM Treasury standards)."

### Revolutionary Vision (Optional Phase 2)

**From REVOLUTIONARY_FEATURE_DESIGN.md:**
- Graph Neural Network policy simulator
- Real-time scenario testing (<1 second vs 6-8 week consulting reports)
- Network effects modeling (spillover benefits)
- Causal inference (not just correlation)
- AI discovers optimal policies

**Status:** Defer to Phase 2 AFTER core 50 questions complete and deployed

QUESTION A1: Which regions have the highest bus routes per capita?

📊 VISUALIZATION
[Horizontal bar chart: Routes per 100k population by region]

📖 DATA STORY
Manchester leads the nation with 42 routes per 100,000 population,
providing extensive network connectivity and multiple journey options.
London follows at 38 routes/100k, leveraging dense urban layout...

💡 KEY INSIGHT
Route density correlates strongly with urban density (r=0.82) but
not with population size, suggesting network design matters more
than scale alone.

📈 POLICY IMPLICATION
Regions below 25 routes/100k should prioritize network expansion
over frequency increases to improve connectivity options.

## 6. WEEK 1: FOUNDATION REPAIR (5 Days)

### ANTI-CHAOS RULES

**MANDATORY BEFORE STARTING:**
- ✅ No moving to Week 2 until ALL Week 1 tasks 100% complete
- ✅ No "quick features" or "just one more thing"
- ✅ Test with REAL data, not placeholders
- ✅ Document blockers immediately, don't work around silently
- ✅ Quality gate: If data missing, STOP and get data first

### DAY 1-2: Data Foundation Fixes

#### Task 1.1: Update BCR Calculator with 2024 TAG Values (4 hours)

**File:** `archive_20251031_cleanup/analysis/spatial/bcr_calculator.py`

**Changes Required:**

```python
# BEFORE (Generic values)
TIME_SAVINGS_VALUE = 25.0  # Generic £/hour
CARBON_VALUE = 250.0       # Outdated £/tonne

# AFTER (2024 DfT TAG official values)
TIME_SAVINGS = {
    'bus_commuting': 9.85,     # £/hour (TAG A1.3 Table 2)
    'car_commuting': 12.65,    # £/hour
    'business': 28.30,         # £/hour
    'leisure': 7.85            # £/hour
}

CARBON_VALUE = 80.0           # £/tonne CO₂ (2024 central estimate)
BUS_EMISSIONS = 0.0965        # kg CO₂e per passenger-km (BEIS 2024)

# Add agglomeration uplift
AGGLOMERATION_UPLIFT = {
    'urban': 0.25,            # 25% uplift for urban areas
    'city_center': 0.50       # 50% uplift for city centers
}

# BCR thresholds (HM Treasury Green Book)
BCR_CATEGORIES = {
    'poor': (0, 1.0),
    'low': (1.0, 1.5),
    'medium': (1.5, 2.0),
    'high': (2.0, 4.0),
    'very_high': (4.0, float('inf'))
}
```

**Validation:**
- Test BCR calculation for £50M investment scenario
- Compare to consulting report benchmarks
- Verify discount rate = 3.5% for 30-year appraisal

**Deliverable:** Updated `bcr_calculator.py` with 2024 values, unit tests passing

---

#### Task 1.2: Parse TransXChange XML Schedules (6-8 hours)

### DAY 3: Build Category Page Template + Insight Engine

#### Task 1.4: Create Reusable Category Component + Dynamic Narrative System (12 hours)

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DECISION (Nov 4, 2025):**

During implementation, discovered that hardcoded narratives (£42M investments, BCR 2.1, "best/worst" comparisons) would create maintenance nightmares across 50+ sections.

**Solution:** Build a **Hybrid Insight Engine** that generates fully dynamic, context-aware narratives.

**Test with Real Data:**
- Load actual regional_summary.csv
- Verify visualizations render correctly
- Check story narratives make sense
- Test region filtering works

**Architecture: Insight Engine System**

To avoid hardcoding narratives across 50+ sections, we build a **5-layer dynamic narrative system**:

**Layer 1: Context Resolver**
- Detects filter state (all regions / single region / subset)
- Prevents "best/worst" comparisons on single-row datasets
- Adapts narrative structure based on data shape

**Layer 2: Centralized Calculators (`calc.py`)**
- TAG 2024 time values, carbon, BCR thresholds (single source of truth)
- BCR calculation wrapper (delegates to existing Green Book calculator)
- Statistical functions: correlations with p-values, CIs, effect sizes
- Equity metrics: Gini, Lorenz curves, Palma ratio
- Gap analysis: investment requirements, routes needed, population affected
- Ranking and distance from benchmarks

**Layer 3: Insight Rules (`rules.py`)**
- Small, testable rules that analyze data patterns
- Evidence-gated: only fire when statistical thresholds met
- Examples: RankingRule, SingleRegionPositioningRule, CorrelationRule, OutlierRule, GapToInvestmentRule
- Each rule has `applies(context, metrics)` and `emit(context, metrics)` methods
- Suppresses insights when data insufficient (low n, high p-values, weak correlations)

**Layer 4: Template Renderer (`templates.py`)**
- Jinja2 templates with conditional blocks
- Consulting-tone text with dynamic value injection
- Context-aware: different templates for all-regions vs single-region vs subsets
- No hardcoded numbers - all values from calculators

**Layer 5: Evidence & Guardrails**
- Data sufficiency checks (minimum n, match rate thresholds)
- Source stamping (NaPTAN, BODS, ONS, TAG 2024)
- Audit payload (JSON with all underlying numbers for QA)
- Unit tests for calculators, golden tests for narratives

**InsightEngine Orchestrator (`engine.py`):**
```python
class InsightEngine:
    def run(self, df, metric_config, filters):
        # 1. Resolve context (all-regions/single/subset)
        context = resolve_context(df, metric_config.groupby, filters)

        # 2. Compute metrics once (centralized calculators)
        metrics = compute_metrics(df, metric_config, context)

        # 3. Select applicable insight rules
        insights = []
        for rule in registry.for_metric(metric_config.id):
            if data_sufficient(metrics, rule.requirements) and rule.applies(context, metrics):
                insights.extend(rule.emit(context, metrics))

        # 4. Render templates
        blocks = [render_template(context, insight) for insight in insights]

        return {
            'summary': blocks['narrative'],
            'key_finding': blocks['key_finding'],
            'recommendation': blocks['policy'],
            'investment': blocks['investment'],
            'sources': metric_config.sources,
            'evidence': metrics  # For QA/export
        }
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero hardcoded values - all numbers computed dynamically
- ✅ Context-aware - adapts to filter selections intelligently
- ✅ Evidence-gated - only shows insights supported by data
- ✅ Reusable across all 50 sections - DRY architecture
- ✅ Testable - unit tests for calculators, golden tests for narratives
- ✅ Maintainable - TAG values updated once, reflected everywhere

**Deliverable:** Category A (Coverage) page 100% complete with dynamic Insight Engine

---

### DAY 4-5: Complete Category A (Coverage & Accessibility)

#### Task 1.5: Answer All 8 Coverage Questions (16 hours)

**Now uses Insight Engine** - All 8 sections will use the dynamic narrative generation system built in Task 1.4

**For Each Question (A3 through A8):** *(A1 and A2 already complete)*

1. **Write data loading function** (30 min)
   - Follow pattern from A1/A2
   - Use dashboard/utils/data_loader.py functions
   - Load relevant datasets
   - Apply filters
   - Calculate metrics

2. **Create visualization** (1 hour)
   - Use Plotly Express or Graph Objects
   - Professional chart titles (no "Figure 1:")
   - Color schemes: Greens for positive, Reds for gaps
   - Interactive tooltips with data values

3. **Define MetricConfig and use Insight Engine** (30 min)
   ```python
   config = MetricConfig(
       id='your_metric_id',
       groupby='region_name',
       value_col='your_metric_column',
       unit='your unit description',
       sources=['NaPTAN', 'BODS', 'ONS 2021', 'TAG 2024'],
       rules=['ranking', 'single_region_positioning', 'variation', 'gap_to_investment']
   )

   result = ENGINE.run(data, config, filters)
   return result  # Contains summary, key_finding, recommendation, investment
   ```
   - **NO hardcoded narratives** - Engine generates everything dynamically
   - Engine handles all contexts (all-regions/single-region/subset)
   - Automatically calculates BCR, investment costs, correlations, gaps

4. **Test with real data** (30 min)
   - Verify numbers correct
   - Test filters work (all-regions vs single-region)
   - Check narrative adapts properly

**Expected Time Per Question:** ~2 hours (reduced from 3 with Insight Engine)
- 30 min: Data loading
- 1 hour: Visualization
- 30 min: MetricConfig + engine integration (replaces 1 hour of manual narrative writing)

**Questions Implementation Order:**

**Day 4 (8 hours):**
- ✅ A1: Routes per capita (COMPLETE with Insight Engine)
- ✅ A2: Stops per 1,000 residents (COMPLETE with Insight Engine)
- ✅ A3: Stop density vs population density scatter (COMPLETE)
- ✅ A4: Bus deserts count (COMPLETE - uses actual LSOA stop distribution)

**Day 5 (8 hours):**
- ✅ A5: Average distance to nearest stop (COMPLETE - uses cKDTree for spatial calculations)
- ✅ A6: DfT accessibility standard compliance (COMPLETE - 400m/500m thresholds)
- ✅ A7: Urban vs rural coverage (COMPLETE - uses ONS RUC classification)
- ✅ A8: High population + low coverage mismatches (COMPLETE - identifies priority zones)

<a name="week-2-3"></a>
## 7. WEEK 2-3: BUILD CORE CATEGORIES (10 Days)

**CRITICAL: All categories use Insight Engine built in Week 1 Task 1.4**

Every section follows this pattern:
1. Load data with data_loader functions
2. Create visualization (Plotly)
3. Define MetricConfig for the section
4. Call `ENGINE.run(data, config, filters)` → Returns dynamic narrative
5. No hardcoded narratives - all text generated by engine

### Week 2: Days 6-10

#### DAY 6-7: Category D (Socio-Economic Correlations - 8 Questions)

**Why This Category Second:**
- Demographics data ready (97% match rate)
- Builds on Coverage insights
- Feeds into Equity analysis (Week 3)

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION PHILOSOPHY (Learned from Category A QA Testing):**

⚠️ **Must apply these patterns from Category A to avoid similar bugs:**

**1. POPULATION-WEIGHTED AVERAGES (Not Simple Means)**
```python
# ❌ WRONG - treats all LSOAs equally:
national_avg = lsoa_data['stops_per_1000'].mean()

# ✅ CORRECT - weights by population:
def calculate_weighted_average_d(df, metric):
    if metric == 'stops_per_1000':
        return (df['num_stops'].sum() / df['total_population'].sum()) * 1000
    elif metric == 'unemployment_rate':
        return (df['unemployed_persons'].sum() / df['working_age_pop'].sum())
    # ... similar for other metrics
```
**Why:** 100-person LSOA shouldn't be weighted equally with 5,000-person LSOA in aggregates

**2. FILTER-AWARE CONDITIONAL RENDERING**
```python
# Each section checks if filter mode makes sense
if filter_mode not in ['all_regions', 'all_urban', 'all_rural']:
    st.info("📊 Correlation analysis requires multiple data points. Available only in multi-region views.")
    st.stop()

if len(filtered_data) < 30:
    st.warning(f"⚠️ Insufficient data ({len(filtered_data)} LSOAs). Need at least 30 for reliable correlation.")
    st.stop()
```

**3. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - No Dual Values**
```python
# Calculate once, use everywhere
national_avg = calculate_weighted_average_d(data, 'stops_per_1000')

# Use in chart
fig.add_vline(x=national_avg, annotation_text=f"National Avg: {national_avg:.1f}")

# Use in narrative
st.markdown(f"...compared to national average of {national_avg:.1f}...")

# Use in metrics
st.metric("vs National", f"{((value/national_avg - 1) * 100):+.1f}%")
```
**Lesson from Category A:** Charts showed 8.3, narratives showed 7.9 → credibility destroyed

**4. STATE MANAGEMENT - Prevent Stale Data**
```python
# Force re-execution when filters change
_d24_key = f"d24_{filter_mode}_{filter_value}"

# Use in stateful operations
@st.cache_data(ttl=3600)
def load_correlation_data(filter_mode, filter_value, section_key):
    # section_key ensures cache invalidation on filter change
    ...
```

**5. STATISTICAL RIGOR - No Claims Without Evidence**
```python
# Always check statistical significance
corr, p_value = stats.pearsonr(x, y)

if p_value < 0.001:
    st.success(f"✅ **Highly significant** correlation (r={corr:.3f}, p<0.001)")
elif p_value < 0.05:
    st.success(f"✅ **Significant** correlation (r={corr:.3f}, p={p_value:.3f})")
else:
    st.warning(f"⚠️ Correlation not statistically significant (r={corr:.3f}, p={p_value:.3f})")
    # Don't make claims about the relationship
```

**6. FILTER COMBINATIONS TO TEST (30 Total)**
- 10 geographic scopes × 3 urban/rural = 30 combinations
- Every section must handle ALL 30 gracefully
- Show appropriate messages when filter doesn't match section requirements
